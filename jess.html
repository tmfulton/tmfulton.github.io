Happy Birthday, Jess, let's give a cheer, 
From Philly's suburbs to the DMV last year. 

Nonprofit passion, your mission's so true, 
It drives your purpose in all that you do. 

Today is special for you and Leo too, 
Birthday love for both of you. 

With an espresso martini, you know how to toast, 
It's your heart that's always giving the most. 

Karaoke nights and disco balls’ light, Shorter than five feet, 
but your heart's full of might. 

Halloween’s your favorite, with spooky delight,
With a glittering ball, you light up the night. 
 
Our friendship’s a treasure, laughter so grand, 
With SpongeBob, dancing, and gaming at hand. 

We tear up the floor at recessions with glee, Loving to eat, 
just you and me. 

You're sweet, kind, and unique in every way,
Happy Birthday, dear Jess, enjoy your special day!
